    "1.Decision Tree Classifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: A decision tree classifier is a flowchart-like structure where each internal node represents a test on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label.\n",
    "How It Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Root Node Creation: Start with the entire dataset as the root.\n",
    "Splitting: Use a criterion (e.g., Gini impurity, entropy) to split the dataset into subsets. The goal is to maximize the homogeneity of the resulting subsets.\n",
    "Recursive Splitting: Recursively split each subset into smaller subsets until one of the stopping criteria is met (e.g., maximum depth, minimum samples per leaf, all samples have the same class).\n",
    "Leaf Nodes: Assign a class label to each leaf node based on the majority class of the samples in that node.\n",
    "Prediction: For a new sample, traverse the tree from the root to a leaf node by following the splits corresponding to the sample's attribute values. The class label of the leaf node is the prediction."
